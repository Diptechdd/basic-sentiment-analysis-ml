# Basic Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand and implement a
basic sentiment analysis system using classical machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The project uses a labeled dataset of social media reviews stored in
`data/social_media_reviews.csv`.

## Methodology
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning and normalization)
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
3. Model training using Naive Bayes classifier
4. Performance evaluation using standard metrics

## Model Training
The sentiment classifier is trained on textual data transformed into
numerical features using TF-IDF. A probabilistic Naive Bayes model is
used due to its simplicity and effectiveness for text classification.

## Evaluation and Results
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

These metrics help analyze both overall performance and class-wise errors.

## Conclusion
This project provides a foundational understanding of sentiment analysis
and demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow suitable for
educational and introductory research purposes.
