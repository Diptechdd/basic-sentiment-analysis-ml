# Basic Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand and implement a basic sentiment analysis system using classical machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of text samples labeled with sentiment polarity (positive or negative).  
(Source: publicly available dataset)

## Methodology
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF
- Classification using basic machine learning models

## Experiments
Different models were trained and evaluated to analyze their performance on unseen data.

## Results
The results demonstrate that basic machine learning models can effectively classify sentiment with reasonable accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project provides a foundational understanding of sentiment analysis and the end-to-end machine learning workflow.
